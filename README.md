# Glitch.com PHP Skeleton

This is a super basic skeleton to get PHP working out of the box for glitch.com. 
You should be able to download this project, and get PHP running for your glitch
application.

Glitch currently seems to support PHP 7.0, but does have a bunch of extensions
already set up. There is a good chance your framework of choice might work without
too many changes.
